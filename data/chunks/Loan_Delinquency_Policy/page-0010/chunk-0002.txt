The Credit Union would like very much to have worked with you to resolve this matter without 
resorting to outside action.  We were willing to negotiate; however, with your erratic payment 
history and no consideration given to a consistent payment plan, the Credit Union is left with no 
alternative but to pursue this course of action. 
 
The Promissory Note you signed when the loan was granted is a legal contract between you and 
the RPI Employees’ Federal Credit Union, with all of the duties and obligations of both parties 
clearly spelled out.  In accordance with the promissory note you are required to pay all collection 
agency fees and/or attorney fees.
