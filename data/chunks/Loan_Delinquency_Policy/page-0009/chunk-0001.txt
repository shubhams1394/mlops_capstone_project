Dear ________: 
 
I write to remind you of our contractual agreement with regard to your delinquent loan account.    
 
As of today’s date this account is seventy-four (74) days delinquent.  The overdue amount $.    
This amount includes $45.00 in late fee charges.  As long as your account remains 
delinquent this fee will automatically be added on the 15th of each month.     
 
Name, we are willing to work with you to resolve this matter; however, if you continue to ignore 
our request for payment or to contact this office to make payment arrangements, we will be 
forced to turn the matter over to our attorney. 
 
I trust you will take the opportunity to contact the Credit Union Office by Friday, January 28, 
2011 in order that arrangements can be made to bring your account up to date. 
 
This matter demands your immediate attention.  
 
Sincerely yours,
