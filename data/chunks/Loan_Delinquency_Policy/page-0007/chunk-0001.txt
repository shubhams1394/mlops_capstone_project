Dear Name: 
 
Your loan account is past due.    
 
The amount of the delinquency is $. 
 
I am sure this is just an oversight, and would appreciate a check from you by the close of 
business on January 28. 2011.  As a reminder, in accordance with our loan policy, all delinquent 
loans are automatically assessed a $15.00 late fee on the 15th of each month.  
 
If for some reason you are unable to pay, please call me at (518) 276-6591. 
 
If your check is already on the way, please disregard this letter. 
 
Sincerely,
