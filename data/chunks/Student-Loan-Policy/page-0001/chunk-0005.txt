pay any outstanding balance you may have. 
Loan Adjustments: If you have received a loan and other funding is awarded, which brings you to a 
negative unmet need, your loan award will be adjusted accordingly. In other words, if you have received 
$500 in loan and you get a $200 scholarship after the loan has been paid, which brings your unmet need 
to a negative $200, we need to return $200 from the loan payment. You are not allowed to receive more 
than the cost of attendance (unmet need).
