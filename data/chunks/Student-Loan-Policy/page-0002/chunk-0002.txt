October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017. Terms and conditions of Title IV Loans may be more favorable 
than Private education loans. 
Repayment: Repayment begins following a six-month grace period after you graduate, withdraw from 
school, or drop below half-time enrollment. 
More money? If you think your financial aid award will not cover all of your educational costs, you may be 
eligible for an unsubsidized Stafford Loan. Another option may be the Parent Loan for Undergraduate 
Students (PLUS), which is available to parents for dependent students. If you have special circumstances 
that change your financial situation, we have an appeal process.
