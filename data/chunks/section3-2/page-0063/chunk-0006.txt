Collateral Assignment 
   
An assignment is generally considered as the transfer of a 
legal right from one person to another.  The rights 
acquired under a contract may be assigned if they relate to 
money or property, but personal services may not be 
assigned.  Collateral assignments are used to establish the 
bank's rights as l ender in the property or asset serving as 
collateral.  It is generally used for loans secured by savings 
deposits, certificates of deposit or other cash accounts as 
well as loans backed by cash surrender value of life 
insurance.  In some instances, it is u sed in financing 
accounts receivable and contracts.  If a third party holder 
of the collateral is involved, such as life insurance 
company or the payor of an assigned contract, an 
acknowledgement should be obtained from that party as to 
the bank's assigned interest in the asset for collateral 
purposes.
