designated time period; and 
• Provide that no more than one payday loan is 
outstanding with the bank at a time to any one 
borrower. 
 
Accrued Fees and Finance Charges 
 
Institutions should eval uate the collectibility of accrued 
fees and finance charges on payday loans because a 
portion of accrued interest and fees is generally not 
collectible.  Although regulatory reporting instructions do 
not require payday loans to be placed on nonaccrual base d 
on delinquency status, institutions should employ 
appropriate methods to ensure that income is accurately 
measured.  Such methods may include providing loss 
allowances for uncollectible fees and finance charges or 
placing delinquent and impaired receivables on nonaccrual 
status.  After a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, 
subsequent fees and finance charges imposed on the 
borrower would not be recognized in income and accrued, 
but unpaid fees and finance charges normally would be 
reversed from income.
