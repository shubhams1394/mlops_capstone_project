Risk Management Framework 
 
Given the high risk profile of leveraged transactions, 
financial institutions engaged in leveraged lending should 
adopt a risk management framework that has an intensive 
and frequent review and monitoring process. The 
framework should have as its foundation written risk 
objectives, risk acceptance criteria, and risk controls. A 
lack of robust risk management processes and controls at a 
financial institution with significant l everaged lending 
activities could contribute to supervisory findings that the 
financial institution is engaged in unsafe -and-unsound 
banking practices.
