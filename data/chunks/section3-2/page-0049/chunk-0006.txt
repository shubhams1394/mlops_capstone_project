loan that has been charged-off. 
 
Such TDRs generally may take any of three forms. In 
certain TDRs, the "B" note may be a contingent receivable 
that is payable only if certain conditions are met (e.g., 
sufficient cash flow from property).   For other TDRs, the 
"B" note may be contingently forgiven (e.g., note "B" is 
forgiven if note "A" is paid in full).   In other instances, an 
institution would have granted a concession (e.g., rate 
reduction) to the troubled borrower but the "B" note would 
remain a contractual obligation of the borrower.  Because 
the "B" note is not reflected as an asset on the institution's 
books and is unlikely to be collected, for reporting 
purposes the "B" note could be viewed as a contingent
