(generally a minimum of six months) by the borrower, 
in accordance with the contractual terms involving 
payments of cash or cash equivalents. 
 
When the regulatory reporting criteria for restoration to 
accrual status are met, previous charge- offs taken would 
not have to be fully recover ed before such loans are 
returned to accrual status.  Loans that meet the above 
criteria would continue to be disclosed as past due, as 
appropriate, until they have been brought fully current. 
 
Troubled Debt Restructuring  - Multiple Note 
Structure 
 
The bas ic example of a trouble debt restructure ( TDR) 
multiple note structure is a troubled loan that is 
restructured into two notes where the first or "A" note 
represents the portion of the original loan principal amount 
which is expected to be fully collected along with 
contractual interest.  The second part of the restructured 
loan, or "B" note, represents the portion of the original 
loan that has been charged-off.
