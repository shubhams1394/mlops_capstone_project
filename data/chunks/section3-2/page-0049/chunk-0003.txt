general standard.  First, consumer loans and real estate 
loans secured by one -to-four family residential properties 
are exempt from the nonaccrual guidelines.  Nonetheless, 
these exempt loans should be subject to other alternative 
methods of evaluation to assure the bank's net income is 
not materially overstated.  Second, any State  statute, 
regulation or rule which imposes more stringent standards 
for nonaccrual of interest should take precedence over 
these instructions.  Third, reversal of previously accrued 
but uncollected interest applicable to any asset placed in a 
nonaccrual status, and treatment of subsequent payments 
as either principal or interest, should be handled in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  
Acceptable accounting treatment includes reversal of all 
previously accrued but uncollected interest against 
appropriate income and balance sheet accounts.
