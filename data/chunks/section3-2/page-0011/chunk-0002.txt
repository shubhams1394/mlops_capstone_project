generally considered the most reliable. 
 
There are two common approaches employed when using 
the income method.  The “capitalized cash flow” method 
determines the value of a company as the present value of 
all future cash flows the business can generate in 
perpetuity.  An appropriate cash flow is determined and 
then divided by a risk- adjusted capitalization rate, most 
commonly the weighted average cost of capital.  This 
method is most appropriate when cash flows are 
predictable and stable.  The “discounted cash flow” 
method is a multiple -period valuation model that converts 
a future series o f cash flows into current value by 
discounting those cash flows at a rate of return (referred to 
as the “discount rate”) that reflects the risk inherent 
therein.  This method is most appropriate when future cash 
flows are cyclical or variable over time.  B oth income 
methods involve numerous assumptions, and therefore,
