Re-aging, Extensions, Deferrals, Renewals, or Rewrites   
 
Re-aging is the pr actice of bringing a delinquent account 
current after the borrower has demonstrated a renewed 
willingness and ability to repay the loan by making some, 
but not all, past due payments. Re -aging of open- end 
accounts, or extensions, deferrals, renewals, or re writes of 
closed-end accounts should only be used to help borrowers 
overcome temporary financial difficulties, such as loss of 
job, medical emergency, or change in family 
circumstances like loss of a family member. A permissive 
policy on re -agings, extensi ons, deferrals, renewals, or 
rewrites can cloud the true performance and delinquency 
status of the portfolio. However, prudent use of a policy is 
acceptable when it is based on recent, satisfactory 
performance and the true improvement in a borrower's 
other credit factors, and when it is structured in accordance 
with internal policies.
