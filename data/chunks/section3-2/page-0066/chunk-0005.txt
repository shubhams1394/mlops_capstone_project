of another; amounts which a party owes are netted against 
amounts which are owed to that party.  If a bank exercises 
its right of setoff properly and before the bankruptcy 
filing, the action is generally upheld in the bankruptcy 
proceedings.  Setoffs made after the bankruptcy may also 
be valid but certain requirements must be met of which the 
following are especially important: First, the debts must be  
between the same parties in the same right and capacity.  
For example, it would be improper for the bank to setoff 
the debtor's loan against a checking account of the estate 
of the obligor's father, of which the debtor is executor. 
Second, both the debt and the deposit must precede the 
bankruptcy petition filing.  Third, the setoff may be 
disallowed if funds were deposited in the bank within 90 
days of the bankruptcy filing and for the purpose of 
creating or increasing the amount to be set off.
