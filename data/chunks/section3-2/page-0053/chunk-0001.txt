If the measure of a loan calculated in accordance with FAS 
114 is less than the book value of that loan, impairment 
should be recognized as a valuation allowance against the 
loan.  For regulatory reporting and examination report 
purposes, this valuation allowance is included as part of 
the general allowance for loan and lease losses.  In

value less cost to sell) should similarly be charged-off.
