investment in the loan , a loss is charged to the  ALLL.  
When property is received in full satisfaction of an asset 
other than a loan (e.g., a debt security), the loss should be 
reflected in a manner consistent with the balance sheet 
classification of the asset satisfied.  When long-lived assets 
that will be sold, such as real estate, are received in full 
satisfaction of a loan, the real estate is recorded at its fair 
value less cost to sell.  This fair value (less cost to sell) 
becomes the “cost” of the foreclosed asset.  
 
To illustrate, assume a bank forecloses on a defaulted 
mortgage loan of $100,000 and takes title to the property.  
If the fair value of the realty at the time of foreclosure is 
$90,000 and costs to sell are estimated at $10,000, a 
$20,000 loss should be immediately recognized by a 
charge to the ALLL.  The cost of the foreclosed asset 
becomes $80,000.  If the bank is on an accrual basis of 
accounting, there may also be adjusting entries necessary
