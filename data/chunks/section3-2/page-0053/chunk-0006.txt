market rate.  This economic value is the proper carrying 
value for the asset at its origination date, and if less than 
the fair value less cost to sell at time of foreclosure (e.g., 
$78,000 vs. $80,000), an additional loss has been incurred 
and should be immediately recognized.  This additional 
loss should be reflected in the allowance if a relatively 
brief period has elapsed  between foreclosure and 
subsequent resale of the property.  However, the loss 
should be treated as "other operating expenses" if the asset 
has been held for a longer period.  The new loan would be 
placed on the books at its face value ($100,000) and the 
difference between the new loan amount and the 
"economic value" ($78,000) is treated as unearned 
discount ($22,000). For examination and Call Report 
purposes, the asset would be shown net of the unearned 
discount which is reduced periodically as it is earne d over
