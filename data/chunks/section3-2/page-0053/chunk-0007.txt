purposes, the asset would be shown net of the unearned 
discount which is reduced periodically as it is earne d over 
the life of the new loan. Interest income is earned on the 
restructured loan at the previously established market rate. 
This is computed by multiplying the carrying value (i.e., 
face amount of the loan reduced by any principal 
payments, less unearned discount) by that rate (20 
percent).   
 
The basis for this accounting approach is the assumption
