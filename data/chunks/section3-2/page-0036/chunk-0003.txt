with all USPAP standards -  without departing from any 
binding requirements  - and specific guideline s when 
estimating market value.  When performing a Limited 
Appraisal, the appraiser elects to invoke the Departure 
Provision which allows the appraiser to depart, under 
limited conditions, from standards identified as specific 
guidelines.  For example, in a Limited Appraisal, the 
appraiser might not utilize all three approaches to value; 
however, departure from standards designated as binding 
requirements is not permitted.  There are numerous 
binding requirements which are detailed in the USPAP.  
Use of the  USPAP Standards publication as a reference is 
recommended.  The book provides details on each 
appraisal standard and advisory opinions issued by the 
Appraisal Standards Board. 
 
An institution and appraiser must concur that use of the 
Departure Provision i s appropriate for the transaction 
before the appraiser commences the appraisal assignment.
