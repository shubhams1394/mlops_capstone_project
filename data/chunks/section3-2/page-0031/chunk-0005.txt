A financial institution with credit card clearing activities 
should develop its own internal controls and procedures to 
ensure sound agent selection standards before engaging an 
ISO.  ISOs that seek to be compensated solely on the basis 
of the volume of signed- up merchants should be carefully 
scrutinized.  A c learing institution should adequately 
supervise the ISO's activities , just as the institution should 
supervise any third party engaged to perform services for 
any aspect of the institution's operations.  Also, it should 
reserve the right to ratify or reject any merchant contract 
that is initiated by an ISO. 
 
Examination procedures for reviewing credit card related 
merchant activitie s are included in the Examination 
Documentation Modules in the Supplemental Modules 
Section and in the Credit Card Specialty  Bank 
Examination Guidelines.
