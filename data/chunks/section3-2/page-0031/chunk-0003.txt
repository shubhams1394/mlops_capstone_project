operations must closely monitor their merchants.  
Controls should be in place to ensure that early 
warning signs are recognized so that problem 
merchants can be removed from a clearing institution's

clearing institution should establish an account 
administration program that, at a minimum,

financial statements and business activities. 
• A clearing institution should establish an internal 
periodic reporting system of merchant account 
activities regardl ess of the amount or number of 
transactions cleared, and these reports should be 
reviewed for irregularities so that the Clearing 
Institution alerts itself quickly to problematic 
merchant activity.  
• Clearing institutions should follow the guidelines that 
are established by the card issuing networks.
