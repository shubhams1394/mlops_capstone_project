policy.  For subprime loans that are not adversely 
classified, the ALLL should be sufficient to absorb at least 
all estimated credit losses on outstanding balances over the 
current operating cycle, typically 12 months.  To the extent 
that the historical net charge -off rate is used to estimate 
expected credit losses, it should be adjusted for changes in 
trends, conditions, and other relevant factors, including 
business volume, underwriting, risk selection, account 
management practices, and current economic or business 
conditions that may alter such experience.
