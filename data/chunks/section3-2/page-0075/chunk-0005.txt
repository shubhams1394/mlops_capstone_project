perception of a lender’s practices, the nature of these risks 
is inherently unpredictable.  Institutions that engage in 
subprime lending must take special care to avoid violati ng 
consumer protection laws.  An adequate compliance 
management program must identify, monitor and control 
the consumer protection hazards associated with subprime 
lending.  The institution should have a process in place to 
handle the potential for heighte ned legal action.  In 
addition, management should have a system in place to 
monitor consumer complaints for recurring issues and 
ensure appropriate action is taken to resolve legitimate 
disputes.

comprehensive independent reviews of subprime 
activities.  Audit procedures should ensure, among other 
things, that a sufficient volume of accounts is sampled to 
verify the integrity of the records, particularly with respect 
to payments processing.
