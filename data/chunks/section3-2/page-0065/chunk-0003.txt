miscellaneous items up to $400 plus any unused portion of 
the homeowner's equity.  The bankruptcy code recognizes 
a greater amount of exemptions may be available under 
State law and, if State law is silent or unless it provides to 
the contrary, the debt or is given the option of electing 
either the Federal or State exemptions.  Examiners should 
note that some liens on exempt property which would 
otherwise be enforceable are rendered unenforceable by 
the bankruptcy.  A secured lender may thus become 
unsecured with respect to the exempt property.  The basic 
rule in these situations is that the debtor can render 
unenforceable judicial liens on any exempt property and 
security interests that are both nonpurchase money and 
nonpossessory on certain household goods, tools of the 
trade and health aids. 
   
Discharge and Objections to Discharge 
   
The discharge, as mentioned previously, protects the 
debtor from further liability on the debts discharged.
