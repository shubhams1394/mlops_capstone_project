as soon as allowed by law.  Updated collateral valuations 
are typically obtained early in the collections process to 
assist in determining appropriate collection efforts.  
Frequent collateral inspections are often used by lenders to 
monitor the condition of the collateral. 
 
Subprime Credit Card Lending 
 
Underwriting.  Subprime credit card lenders use risk -
based pricing as well as tightly controlled credit limits to 
mitigate the increased credit risk.  In addition, lenders may 
require full or partial collateral coverage, typically in the 
form of a deposit account at the institution, for the higher -
risk segments of the subprime market.  Initial credit lines 
are set at low levels, such as $300 to $1,000, and 
subsequent line increases are typically smaller than for 
prime credit card accounts.  Increases in credit lines should 
be subject to stringent underwriting criteria similar to that 
required at origination.
