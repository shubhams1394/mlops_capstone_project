costs are higher than expected, or other factors result in a 
shortfall in available funds for debt repayment.  The 
second type of carryover loan refers to already -existing 
term debt whose repayment terms or maturities need to be 
rescheduled because of inadequate cash flow to meet 
existing repayment requirements.  This need for 
restructuring can arise from the same factors that lead to 
carryover production or feeder livestock loans.  Carryover 
loans are generally restructured on an intermediate or 
long-term amortization, depending upon the type of 
collateral provided, the borrower’s debt service capacity 
from ongoing operations, the  debtor’s overall financial 
condition and trends, or other variables.  The restructuring 
may also be accompanied by acquisition of Federal  
guarantees through the farm credit system to lessen risk to 
the bank.
