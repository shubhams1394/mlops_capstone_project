storage, housing, and handling of grain or livestock).  The 
production of crops a nd livestock is especially vulnerable 
to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of

weather conditions.  While examiners must be alert to, and 
critical of, operational and managerial weak nesses in 
agricultural lending activities, they must also recognize

external risk factors.  Accordingly, loan restructurings or 
extended repayment terms, or other constructive steps to 
deal with f inancial difficulties faced by agricultural 
borrowers because of adverse weather or commodity 
conditions, will not be criticized if done in a prudent
