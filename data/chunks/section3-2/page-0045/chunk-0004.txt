commercial loan liability to the bank, and the postings 
thereto will depict a history of the debt.  Collateral records 
should be scrutinized to acquire the necessary descriptive 
information and to ascertain that the collateral held to 
secure the notes is as transcribed. 
   
Gathering credit information is an important process and 
should be done with care to obtain the essential 
information, which will enable the examiner to appraise 
the loans accurately and fairly.  Failure to obtain and 
record pertinent information contained in the credit files 
can reflect unfavorably on examiners, and a good deal of 
examiner and loan officer time can be saved by carefully 
analyzing the files.  Ideally, credit files will also contain 
important correspondence between the bank and the 
borrower.  However, this is not univer sally the case; in 
some instances, important correspondence is deliberately 
lodged in separate files because of its sensitive character.
