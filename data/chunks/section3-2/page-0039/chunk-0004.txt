Recourse Arrangements  - Recourse arrangements may, 
or may not, pre clude loan participations from being 
accounted for as sales for financial reporting purposes.  
The date of the participation and the formality of the 
recourse provision affect the accounting for the 
transaction.  Formal recourse provisions may affect the 
accounting treatment of a participation depending upon the 
date that the participation is transferred to another 
institution.  Implicit recourse provisions would not affect 
the financial reporting treatment of a participation because 
the accounting standards look to the contractual terms of 
asset transfers in determining whether or not the criteria 
necessary for sales accounting treatment have been met.  
Although implicit recourse provisions would not affect the 
accounting treatment of a loan participation, they may 
affect the risk-based capital treatment of a participation.
