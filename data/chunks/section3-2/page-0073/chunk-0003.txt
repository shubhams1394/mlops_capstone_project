should include “shock” testing of basic assumptions such 
as delinquency rates, loss rates, and recovery rates o n 
collateral.  It should also consider other potentially adverse 
scenarios, such as: changing attrition or prepayment rates; 
changing utilization rates for revolving products; changes 
in credit score distribution; and changes in the capital 
markets demand for whole loans, or asset -backed 
securities supported by subprime loans. 
 
These are representative examples .  Actual factors will 
vary by product, market segment, and the size and 
complexity of the portfolio relative to the institution’s 
overall operations .  Whether stress tests are performed 
manually, or through automated modeling techniques, the 
Regulatory Agencies will expect that:  
 
• The process is clearly documented, rational, and easily 
understood by the board and senior management; 
• The inputs are reli able and relate directly to the 
subject portfolios;
