management program for subprime lenders.

lending, the board and management should ensure that 
proposed activities are consistent with the institution's 
overall business strategy and risk tolerances, a nd that all 
involved parties have properly acknowledged and 
addressed critical business risk issues. These issues 
include the costs associated with attracting and retaining 
qualified personnel, investments in the technology 
necessary to manage a more compl ex portfolio, a clear 
solicitation and origination strategy that allows for after -
the-fact assessment of underwriting performance, and the 
establishment of appropriate feedback and control systems.

risk and appropriately incorporate operating, compliance, 
market, liquidity, reputation and legal risks.
