problems in a timely manner; 
• Analyzed all significant factors that affect the 
collectibility of the portfolio; and 
• Established an acceptable ALLL evaluation process 
that meets the objectives for an adequate ALLL.  
 
If, after the completion of all aspects of the ALLL review 
described in this section, the examiner does not concur that 
the reported ALLL level is adequate, or the ALLL 
evaluation process is deficient, recommendations  for 
correcting these problems, including any examiner 
concerns regarding an appropriate level for the ALLL, 
should be noted in the Report of Examination. 
 
Regulatory Reporting of the ALLL 
 
An ALLL established in accordance with the guidelines 
provided above should fall within a range of acceptable 
estimates.  When an ALLL is deemed inadequate, 
management will be required to increase the provision for 
loan and lease loss expense sufficiently to restore the 
ALLL reported in its Call Report or TFR to an adequ ate 
level.
