A systematic methodology that is properly designed and

of the ALLL.  Accordingly, institutions should adjust their

Examiners are encouraged, with the acknowledgement of 
management, to communicate with an institution’s 
external audit ors and request an explanation of their 
rationale and findings, when differences in judgment 
concerning the adequacy of the institution's ALLL exist.
