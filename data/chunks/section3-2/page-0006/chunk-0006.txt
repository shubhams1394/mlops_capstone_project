the consensus reached by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on 
Issue No. 85 -44, Differences Between Loan Loss 
Allowances for GAAP and RAP.   This issue deals with 
the situation where regulators mandated that institutions 
establish loan loss allowances under regul atory accounting 
principles (RAP) that may be in excess of amounts 
recorded by the institution in preparing its financial 
statement under"GAAP.  The EITF was asked whether and 
under what circumstances this can occur.  The consensus 
indicated that auditors should be particularly skeptical in 
the case of GAAP/RAP differences and must justify them 
based on the particular facts and circumstances. 
 
Additional guidance on the establishment of loan review 
systems and an adequate ALLL is provided in the 
Interagency Statement of Policy on the ALLL dated 
December 21, 1993, and the Interagency Policy Statement 
on Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Methodologies
