However, a financial institution may consider support 
from a sponsor in assigning internal risk ratings when the 
institution can document the sponsor’s history of 
demonstrated support as well as the economic incentive, 
capacity, and stated intent to continue to support the 
transaction.  However, even with documented capacity and 
a history of support, the sponsor’s pot ential contributions 
may not mitigate supervisory concerns absent a 
documented commitment of continued support. An 
evaluation of a sponsor’s financial support should include 
the following: 
• The sponsor’s historical performance in supporting its 
investments, financially and otherwise; 
• The sponsor’s economic incentive to support, 
including the nature and amount of capital contributed 
at inception; 
• Documentation of degree of support (for example, a 
guarantee, comfort letter, or verbal assurance); 
• Consideration of the sponsor’s contractual investment 
limitations;
