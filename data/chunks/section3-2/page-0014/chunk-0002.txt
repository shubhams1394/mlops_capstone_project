Oil and Gas Lending 
 
Industry Overview 
 
Oil and gas (O&G) lending is complex and highly 
specialized due to factors such as global supply and 
demand, geopolitical uncertainty, weather -related 
disruptions, fluctuations and volatility in currency markets 
(i.e. the strength of the U.S . dollar compared to global 
currency markets), and changes in environmental and 
other governmental policies.  As such, companies and 
borrowers that are directly or indirectly tied to the O&G 
industry frequently experience expansion and contraction 
within k ey operational areas of their businesses that will 
directly impact their financial condition and repayment 
capacity.   
 
The O&G industry has four interconnected segments: 
 
• Upstream - exploration and production (E&P) 
companies 
• Midstream - transporting, treating, processing, storing, 
and marketing to Upstream companies 
• Downstream - refining and marketing
