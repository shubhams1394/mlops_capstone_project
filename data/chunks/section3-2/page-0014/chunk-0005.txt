RBL may appear similar to traditional asset based lending 
(ABL), but there are notable differences.  The primary 
source of repayment for ABL is the orderly liquidation of 
the collateral (receivables and inv entory) into cash.  Such 
loans are typically structured with strong controls over the 
collateral, such as a lock box arrangement.  In contrast, the 
primary source of repayment for RBL is the cash flows 
derived from the extraction of O&G reserves.  An 
independent, third-party reserve engineering report serves 
as the primary underwriting tool to estimate the future cash 
stream and establish a “borrowing base,” which is a 
collateral base agreed to by the borrower and lender that is 
used to limit the amount of funds the lender advances the 
borrower.  The borrowing base is subject to periodic 
redeterminations, typically semiannually, that can result in 
the reduction of the borrowing base commitment when 
commodity prices and reserves are declining.
