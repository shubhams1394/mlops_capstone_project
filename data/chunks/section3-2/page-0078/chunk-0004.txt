generally have cash flow difficulties and few, if any, 
lower-cost borrowing alternatives.  In addition, some 
payday lenders perform minimal analysis of the 
borrower’s ability to repay either at the loan’s inception or 
upon refinancing; they may merely require a curren t pay 
stub or proof of a regular income source and evidence that 
the customer has a checking account.  Other payday 
lenders use scoring models and consult nationwide 
databases that track bounced checks and persons with 
outstanding payday loans.  However, payday lenders 
typically do not obtain or analyze information regarding 
the borrower’s total level of indebtedness or information 
from the major national credit bureaus.  The combination 
of the borrower’s limited financial capacity, the unsecured 
nature of the credit, and the limited underwriting analysis 
of the borrower’s ability to repay pose substantial credit 
risk for insured depository institutions.
