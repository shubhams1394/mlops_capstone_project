or debiting the borrower’s account or by having the 
borrower redeem the check with a cash payment.  If the 
borrower informs the lender that he or she does not have 
the funds to repay the loan, the loan is often refinanced 
(payday lenders may use the terms “rollover,” “same day 
advance,” or “consecutive advance”) through payment of 
an additional finance charge.  If the borrower does not 
redeem the check in cash and the loan is not refinanced, 
the lender normally puts the check or debit authorization 
through the payment system.  If the borrower’s deposit 
account has insufficient funds, the borrower typically 
incurs a NSF charge on this account.  If the check or the 
debit is returned to the lender unpaid, the lender also may 
impose a returned item fee plus collection charges on the
