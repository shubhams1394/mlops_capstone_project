significant risk exposures are perceived, but Loss 
cannot be determined because of specific reasonable 
pending factors which may strengthen the credit in the 
near term.  Examiners should attempt to identify Loss 
in the credit where possible thereby limiting the 
excessive use of the Doubtful classification. 
• Loss - Advances in excess of calculated current fair 
value which are considered uncollectible and do not 
warrant continuance as bankable assets.  There is little 
or no prospect for near term improvement and no 
realistic strengthening action of significance pending. 
 
Technical Exceptions 
   
Deficiencies in documentation of loans should be brought 
to the attention of management for remedial action.  
Failure of management to effect corrections may lead to 
the development of greater credit risk in the future.  
Moreover, an excessive number of technical exceptions 
may be a reflection on management's quality and ability.
