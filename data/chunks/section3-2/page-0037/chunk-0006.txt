refinancings; however, in certain situations an appraisal is 
required.  If new funds are advanced in excess of 
reasonable closing costs, an institution is expected to 
obtain a new appraisal for the renewal of an existing 
transaction when there is a material change in market 
conditions or in the physical aspects of the property that 
threatens the institution's real estate collateral protection. 
 
The decision to reappraise or reevaluate the real estate 
collateral should be guided by the exemption for renewals, 
refinancings, and other subsequent transactions.  Loan 
workouts, debt restructurings, loan assumptions, and 
similar transactions involving the addition or substitution 
of borrowers may qualify for the exemption for renewals, 
refinancings, and other subsequent tra nsactions.  Use of 
this exemption depends on the condition and quality of the 
loan, the soundness of the underlying collateral and the 
validity of the existing appraisal or evaluation.
