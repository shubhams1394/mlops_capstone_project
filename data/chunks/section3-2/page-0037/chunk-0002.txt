estate loan po rtfolio experience and value estimates 
prepared for recent loans on comparable properties might 
provide a basis for evaluations. 
 
An evaluation should provide an estimate of value to assist 
the institution in assessing the soundness of the 
transaction.  Pr udent practices also require that as an 
institution engages in more complex real estate -related 
financial transactions, or as its overall exposure increases, 
a more detailed evaluation should be performed.   For 
example, an evaluation for a home equity loa n might be 
based primarily on information derived from a sales data 
services organization or current tax assessment 
information, while an evaluation for an income -producing 
real estate property should fully describe the current and 
expected use of the property and include an analysis of the 
property's rental income and expenses.
