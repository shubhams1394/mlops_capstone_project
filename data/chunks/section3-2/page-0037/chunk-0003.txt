Qualifications of Evaluation Providers  - Individuals who 
prepare evaluations should have real estate- related training 
or experience and knowledge of the market relevant to the 
subject property.  Based upon their experience and 
training, professionals from several fields may be qualified 
to prepare evaluations of certain types of real estate 
collateral.  Examples include individuals with appraisal 
experience, real estate lenders, consultants or sales 
persons, agricultural extension agents, or foresters.  
Institutions should document the qualifications and 
experience level of individuals whom the institution deems 
acceptable to perform evaluations.  An institution might 
also augment its in -house expertise and hire an outside 
party familiar with a certain market or a particular type of 
property.  Although not required, an institution may use 
state licensed or certified appraisers to prepare evaluations.
