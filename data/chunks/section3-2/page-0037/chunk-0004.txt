property.  Although not required, an institution may use 
state licensed or certified appraisers to prepare evaluations.  
As such, Limited Appraisals rep orted in a Summary or 
Restricted format may be appropriate for evaluations of 
real estate- related financial transactions exempt from the 
agencies' appraisal requirements. 
 
Valid Appraisals and Evaluations  - The agencies allow an 
institution to use an exist ing appraisal or evaluation to 
support a subsequent transaction, if the institution 
documents that the existing estimate of value remains 
valid.   Therefore, a prudent appraisal and evaluation 
program should include criteria to determine whether an 
existing appraisal or evaluation remains valid to support a 
subsequent transaction.  Criteria for determining whether 
an existing appraisal or evaluation remains valid will vary 
depending upon the condition of the property and the 
marketplace, and the nature of any subsequent transaction.
