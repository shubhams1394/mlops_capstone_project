simultaneously with the signing of the order to purchase 
and the agreement to lease.  
   
The types of assets that may be leased are numerous, and 
the accounting for direct leasing is a complex subject 
which is discussed in detail  in FAS 13.  Familiarity with 
FAS 13 is a prerequisite for the management of any bank 
engaging in or planning to engage in direct lease 
financing.  The following terms are commonly 
encountered in direct lease financing:  
 
• Net Lease, one in which the bank i s not directly or 
indirectly obligated to assume the expenses of 
maintaining the equipment.  This restriction does not 
prohibit the bank from paying delivery and set up 
charges on the property.    
• Full Payout Lease, one for which the bank expects to 
realize both the return of its full investment and the 
cost of financing the property over the term of the 
lease.  This payout can come from rentals, estimated 
tax benefits, and estimated residual value of the 
property.
