1970's for the purpose of ensuring consistency among the 
three Federal banking regulators in the classification of 
large syndicated credits. 
 
Each SNC is reviewed annually at its agent bank or a 
designated review bank and the quality rating assigned by 
examiners is reported to all participating banks.  These 
ratings are subsequently used during all examinations of 
participating banks, thus avoiding duplicate reviews of the 
same loan and ensuring consistent treatment with regard to 
regulatory credit ratings.  Examiner s should not change 
SNC ratings during risk management examinations.  Any 
material change in a SNC should be reported to the 
appropriate regional SNC coordinator so that a 
determination can be made as to the appropriate action, 
including inclusion in the credit re-review process.
