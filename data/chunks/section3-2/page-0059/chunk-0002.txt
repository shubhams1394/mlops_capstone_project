examiner's analysis of collateral and credit files is not only 
to obtain information about the loan, but also to de termine 
if proper documentation procedures and practices are 
being utilized.  While examiners are not expected to be 
experts on legal matters, it is important they be familiar 
with the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) adopted by 
their respective states as wel l as other applicable State 
laws governing credit transactions.  A good working 
knowledge of the various documents necessary to attain 
the desired collateral or secured position, and how those 
documents are to be used or handled in the jurisdiction 
relevant to the bank under examination, is also essential.
