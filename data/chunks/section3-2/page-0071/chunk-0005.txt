months, or one or more 60- day delinquencies in the 
last 24 months; 
• Judgment, foreclosure, repossession, or charge -off in 
the prior 24 months; 
• Bankruptcy in the last 5 years; 
• Relatively high default probability as evidenced by, 
for example, a Fair Isaac and Co. risk score (FICO) of 
660 or below (depending on the product/collateral), or 
other bureau or proprietary scores with an equivalent 
default probability likelihood; and/or 
• Debt service-to-income ratio of 50 percent or greater, 
or otherwise limited ability to cover family living 
expenses after deducting total monthly debt -service
