Forms of Bankruptcy Relief 
   
Liquidation and rehabilitation are the two basic types of 
bankruptcy proceedings.  Liquidation is pursued under 
Chapter 7 of the law and involves the bankruptcy trustee 
collecting all of the debtor's nonexempt property, 
converting it into cash and distributing the proceeds 
among the debtor's creditors.  In return, the debtor obtains 
a discharge of all debts outstanding at the time the petition 
was filed which releases the debtor from all liability for 
those pre-bankruptcy debts. 
 
Rehabilitation (sometimes known as reorganization) is 
effected through Chapter 11 or Chapter 13 of the law and 
in essence provides that creditors' claims are satisfied not 
via liquidation of the obligor's assets but rather from future 
earnings.  That is, debtors are allowed to retain their assets
