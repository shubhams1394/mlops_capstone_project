Introduction 
   
Familiarity with the basic terms and concepts of the 
Federal bankruptcy law (formally known as the 
Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978) is necessary in order for 
examiners to make informed judgments concerning the 
likelihood of collection of loans to bankrupt individuals or 
organizations.  The  following paragraphs present  an 
overview of the subject.  Complex situations may arise 
where more in -depth consideration of the bankruptcy 
provisions may be necessary and warrant consultation with 
the bank's attorney, Regional Counsel or other member of 
the Regional Office staff.  For the most part, however, 
knowledge of the following information when coupled 
with review of credit file data and discussion with bank 
management should enable examiners to reach sound 
conclusions as to the eventual repayment of the bank's 
loans.
