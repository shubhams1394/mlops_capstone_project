General 
 
Loans to business enterprises  for commercial or industrial 
purposes, whether proprietorships, partnerships or 
corporations, are commonly described as commercial 
loans.  In asset distribution, commercial or business loans 
frequently comprise one of the most important assets of a 
bank.  They may be secured or unsecured and have  short 
or long- term maturities.  Such loans include working 
capital advances, term loans and loans to individuals for 
business purposes.  
 
Short-term working capital  and seasonal loans provide 
temporary capital in excess of normal needs.  They are 
used to finance seasonal requirements and are repaid at the 
end of the cycle by converting inventory and accounts
