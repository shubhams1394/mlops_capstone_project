concentrations.  It should also be recognized, however, 
that factors such as location and eco nomic environment of 
the area limit some institutions' ability to diversify.  Where

location should be considered when reviewing the policy.  
Management should also consider the need to track and 
monitor the economic and financial condition of specific 
geographic locations, industries and groups of borrowers
