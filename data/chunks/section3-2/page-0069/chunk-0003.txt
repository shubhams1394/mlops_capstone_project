to underwriting the whole amount only if they are unable 
to place the deal fully.  Typically, however, they place the 
bulk of the facility and retain a portion on their books.  For 
their efforts in arranging a deal, these banks collect an 
arrangement fee.

payable regardless of drawdown;   underwriting fees  – a 
percentage of the sum being underwritten; participation 
fees – expressed as a percentage of each bank’s 
participation in the loan; and agency fees  – levied on most 
loans and provide for the appointment of one or more 
agent banks.  The fee may be a percentage of the whole 
facility or a pre-arranged fixed sum.
