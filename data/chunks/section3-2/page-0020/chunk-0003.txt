guidelines suggest maximum s upervisory loan- to-value 
(LTV) limits for various categories of real estate loans and 
explain how the agencies will monitor their use. 
 
Institutions are expected to establish their own internal 
LTV limits consistent with their needs.  These internal 
limits should not exceed the following recommended 
supervisory limits:  
 
• 65 percent for raw land; 
• 75 percent for land development; 
• 80 percent for commercial, multi -family, and other 
non-residential construction; 
• 85 percent for construction of a 1 -to-4 family 
residence;  
• 85 percent for improved property; and   
• Owner-occupied 1- to-4 family home loans have no 
suggested supervisory LTV limits.  However, for any 
such loan with an LTV ratio that equals or exceeds 90 
percent at origination, an institution should require  
appropriate credit enhancement in the form of either 
mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral.
