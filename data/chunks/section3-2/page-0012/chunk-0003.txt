Reporting and Analytics 
 
Financial institutions should diligently monitor higher risk 
credits, including leveraged loans.  A financi al 
institution’s management should receive comprehensive 
reports about the characteristics and trends in such 
exposures at least quarterly, and summaries should be 
provided to the institution’s board of directors.  Policies 
and procedures should identify t he fields to be populated 
and captured by a financial institution’s MIS, which 
should yield accurate and timely reporting to management 
and the board of directors that may include the following: 
• Individual and portfolio exposures within and across 
all busi ness lines and legal vehicles, including the 
pipeline; 
• Risk rating distribution and migration analysis, 
including maintenance of a list of those borrowers 
who have been removed from the leveraged portfolio
