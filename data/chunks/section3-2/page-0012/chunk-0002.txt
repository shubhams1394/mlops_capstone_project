and limited covenants, may m ake problem credit 
discussions and eventual restructurings more difficult for 
an institution as well as result in less favorable outcomes. 
 
A financial institution should formulate credit policies that 
define expectations for the management of adversely rated 
and other high- risk borrowers whose performance departs 
significantly from planned cash flows, asset sales, 
collateral values, or other important targets.  These 
policies should stress the need for workout plans that 
contain quantifiable objectives and measureable time 
frames.  Actions may include working with the borrower 
for an orderly resolution while preserving the institution’s 
interests, sale of the credit in the secondary market, or 
liquidation of collateral. Problem credits should be 
reviewed regularly for risk rating accuracy, accrual status, 
recognition of impairment through specific allocations, 
and charge-offs.
