The variation in contract characteristics of home equity 
debt affects the liquidity of this form of lending.  For debt 
to be easily pooled and sold in the secondary market, it 
needs to be fairly consistent in its credit and interest rate 
characteristics.  The complexity of the collateral structures, 
coupled with the uncertain maturity of revolving credit, 
makes home equity loans considerably less liquid than 
straight first lien, fixed maturity mortgage loans. 
 
While home equity lending is considered to be fairly low -
risk, subprime home equity loans and lending programs 
exist at some banks.  These programs have a higher level 
of risk than traditional home equity lending programs.
