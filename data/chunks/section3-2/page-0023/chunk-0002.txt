states favor the subcontractors (materialmen's liens, etc.), 
although those of other states protect the construction 
lender to the point of first default , provided certain legal 
requirements have been met.  Depending on the type and 
size of project being funded, construction lending can be a 
complex and fairly high- risk venture.  For this reason, 
bank management should ensure that it has enacted 
policies and retained sufficiently trained personnel before 
engaging in this type of lending.   
 
Home Equity Loans 
 
A home equity loan is a loan secured by the equity in a 
borrower's residence. It is generally structured in one of 
two ways.  First, it can be structured as a traditional 
second mortgage loan, wherein the borrower obtains the 
funds for the full amount of the loan immediately and 
repays the debt with a fixed repayment schedule.  Second, 
the home equity borrowing can be structured as a line of 
credit, with a check, credit card, or other access to the line
