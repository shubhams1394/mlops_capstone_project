no longer apply and the institution must have the "express 
determination" letter before making the election.  To 
continue using the tax- book conformity method, the 
institution must request a new letter at each subsequent 
examination that covers the loan review process.  If the 
examiner does not issue an "express determination" letter 
at the end of such an examination, the institution's election 
of the tax -book conformity method is revoked 
automatically as of the beginning of the taxable year that 
includes the date of examination.  However, that 
examiner's decision not to issue an "express 
determination" letter does not invalidate an institution's 
election for any prior years.  The supervisory authority is 
not required to rescind any previously issued "express 
determination" letters.   
 
When an examiner does not issue an "express 
determination" letter, the institution is still allowed tax 
deductions for loans that are wholly or partially worthless.
