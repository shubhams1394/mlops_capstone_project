conditions are satisfied.  Under these rules, loans that are  
charged-off pursuant to specific orders of the institution's 
supervisory authority or that are classified by the 
institution as Loss assets under applicable regulatory 
standards are conclusively presumed to have become 
worthless in the taxable year of the  charge-offs.  These 
special tax rules are effective for taxable years ending on 
or after December 31, 1991. 
 
To be eligible for this accounting method for tax purposes, 
an institution must file a conformity election with its 
Federal income tax return.  The tax regulations also 
require the institution's primary Federal supervisory 
authority to expressly determine that the institution 
maintains and applies loan loss classification standards 
that are consistent with the regulatory standards of its 
supervisory authority.
