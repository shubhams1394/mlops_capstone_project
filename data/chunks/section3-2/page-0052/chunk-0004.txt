accepted with or without recourse.  Any classification or 
totaling of the nonrecourse line can be separately 
identified from the direct or indirect liability of the d ealer.  
Comments and format for scheduling the indirect contracts 
will be essentially the same as for direct paper.  If there is 
direct debt, comments will necessarily have to be more 
extensive and probably will help form a basis for the 
indirect classification. 
 
No general rule can be established as to the proper 
application of dealers' reserves to the examiner's 
classifications.  Such a rule would be impractical because 
of the many methods used by banks in setting up such 
reserves and the various dealer agreements utilized.  
Generally, where the bank is handling a dealer who is not 
financially responsible, weak contracts warrant 
classification irrespective of any balance in the dealer's 
reserve.  Fair and reasonable judgment on the part of the 
examiner will determine application of dealer reserves.
