Examination Treatment 
 
Use of the formula classification approach can result  in 
numerous small dollar adversely classified items .  
Although these classification details are not always  
included in the R eport of Examination, an itemized list is 
to be left with management.  A copy of the listing should 
also be retained in the examination work papers.   
 
Examiner support packages are available which have built 
in parameters of the formula classification policy, and 
which generate a listing of delinquent consumer loans to 
be cl assified in accordance with the policy.  Use of this 
package may expedite the examination in certain cases, 
especially in larger banks.
