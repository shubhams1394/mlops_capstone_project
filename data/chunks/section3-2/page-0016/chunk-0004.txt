the sensitivity case should be sufficiently conservative and 
used to determine whether the borrower has the financial 
capacity to generate adequate cash flow to repay the debt 
during a prolonged low commodity price environment.  
Price deck considerations include, for example, current 
commodity pricing, forward curve projections (future 
price considerations), cost assumptions, discount rates, and 
timing of the various reports.  Management should also 
document any risk- based adjustments applied to each 
proved reserve category.  While the risk -adjusted base 
case projections will generally be used to underwrite 
RBLs, management should consider the ability to repay 
the debt using the risk- adjusted sensitivity case to 
determine potential exposure due to adverse market price 
fluctuations.

RBL credit facilities are typically structured as a revolving 
line of credit (RLOC), a reducing revolving line of credit
