LOANS Section 3.2 
Loans (8-16) 3.2-16 RMS Manual of Examination Policies

As part of the underwriting process, lending personnel 
should prepare both base -case and sensitivity -case 
analyses that focus on the ability of converting the 
underlying collateral into cash to repay the loan, including 
an estimate of the impact that sustained adverse changes in 
market conditions would have on a company’s repayment 
ability.  A base -case analysis uses standard assumption 
scenarios and generally includes a discount to current 
prices against the forward curve (projected futures pricing 
estimates of the commodity).  A sensitivity case analysis 
subjects the O&G reserves to adverse external factors such 
as lower market prices and/or higher operating expenses to 
ascertain the effect o n loan repayment.  Full debt service 
capacity (DSC) should be analyzed using both the base -
case and sensitivity-case scenarios.
