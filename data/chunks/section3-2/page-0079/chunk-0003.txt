service and support, including it s resolution of consumer 
complaints if handled by the third party.  Oversight 
programs should be documented sufficiently to facilitate 
the monitoring and management of the risks associated 
with third-party relationships. 
 
Concentrations 
 
Given the risk inherent in payday lending, concentrations 
of credit in this line of business pose a significant safety 
and soundness concern.  In the context payday lending, a 
concentration would be defined as a volume of payday 
loans totaling 25 percent or more of a bank’s  Tier 1 
capital.  Where concentrations of payday lending are 
noted, bank management should be criticized for a failure 
to diversify risks.  Appropriate supervisory action may be 
necessary to address concentrations, including directing 
the institution to re duce its loans to an appropriate level, 
raising additional capital, or submitting a plan to achieve 
compliance.
