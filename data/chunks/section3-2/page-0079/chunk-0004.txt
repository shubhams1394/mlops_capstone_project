compliance. 
 
Capital Adequacy 
 
Payday lending is among the highest risk subsets of 
subprime lending, and significantly higher levels of capital 
than the sta rting point for subprime loans -  one and a half 
to three times what is appropriate for nonsubprime assets 
of a similar type -  should be required.  Institutions that 
underwrite payday loans may be required to maintain as 
high as one hundred percent of the l oans outstanding 
(dollar-for-dollar capital), depending on the level and 
volatility of risk.  Risks to consider when determining 
capital requirements include the unsecured nature of the 
credit, the relative levels of risk of default, loss in the 
event of default, and the level of classified assets.  The 
degree of legal or reputation risk associated with payday 
lending should also be considered, especially as it relates 
to third party agreements.
