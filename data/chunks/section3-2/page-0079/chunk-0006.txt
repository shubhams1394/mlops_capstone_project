classify individual reta il loans that exhibit signs of credit 
weakness regardless of delinquency status.  Examiners

Most payday loans have well -defined weaknesses that 
jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  Weaknesses include 
limited or no analysis of repayment capacity and the 
unsecured nature of the credit.  In addition, payday loan 
portfolios are characterized by a marked proportion of 
obligors whose paying capacity is questionable.  As a 
result of these weaknesses, payday loan portfolios should 
be classified Substandard.
