which loans are to be subjected to criticism and/or 
comment in the examination report.  Adversely classified 
loans are allocated on the basis of risk to three categories : 
Substandard; Doubtful; and Loss. 
 
Other loans of questionable quality, but involving 
insufficient risk to warrant classification, are designated as 
Special Mention loans.  Loans lacking technical or legal 
support, whether or not adversely classified, should be 
brought to the attention of the bank's management.  If the 
deficiencies in documentation are severe in scope or 
volume, a schedule of such loans should be included in the 
Report of Examination.    
 
Loan classifications are expressions of different degrees of 
a common factor, risk of nonpayment.  All loans involve 
some risk, but the degree varies greatly.  It is incumbent 
upon examiners to avoid classification of sound loans.  
The practice of lending to sound businesses or individuals 
for reasonable periods is a legitimate banking function.
