• Loans which appear to be adequately protected by 
collateral or sound worth, but which involve a 
borrower of poor character risk and credit reputation. 
• Loans which appear to be adequately protected by 
collateral, but which involve a borrower with limited 
or unassessed repayment ability. 
• An abnormal amount of loans involving 
out-of-territory borrowers (excluding large banks 
properly staffed to handle such loans). 
• Loans involving brokered deposits or link financing. 
 
Overlending 
 
It is almost as serious, from the standpoint of ultimate 
losses, to lend a sound financial risk too much money as it 
is to lend  to an unsound risk.  Loans beyond the 
reasonable capacity of the borrower to repay invariably 
lead to the development of problem loans.
