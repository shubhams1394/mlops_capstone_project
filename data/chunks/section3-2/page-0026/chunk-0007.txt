conjunction with other weaknesses, justify an adverse 
classification of the credit, or, at minimum, may mean that 
the margin in the collateral needs to be greater to offset 
this uncertainty.  Moreover, when assessing the adequacy 
of the collater al margin, it must be remembered that 
deteriorating financial trends will, if not arrested, typically 
result in a shrinking of that margin.  Such deterioration can 
also reduce the amount of cash available for debt service 
needs.
