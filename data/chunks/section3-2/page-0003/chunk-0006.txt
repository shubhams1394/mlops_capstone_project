Each bank must maintain an ALLL adequate to absorb 
estimated credit losses associated with the  loan and lease 
portfolio, i.e., loans and leases that the bank has the intent 
and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until 
maturity or payoff.  Each bank should also maintain, as a 
separate liability account, an allowance sufficient to 
absorb estimated credit losses associated with off -balance 
sheet credit instruments such as off -balance sheet loan 
commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees.
