Special Mention Assets 
 
Definition - A Special Mention asset has potential 
weaknesses that deserve management's close attention.  If 
left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in 
deterioration of the repayment prospects for the a sset or in 
the institution's credit position at some future date.  Special 
Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not 
expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse 
classification. 
 
Use of Special Mention - The Special Mention category is 
not to be used as a means of avoiding a clear decision to 
classify a loan or pass it without criticism.  Neither should 
it include loans listed merely "for the record" when 
uncertainties and complexities, perhaps coupled with large 
size, create som e reservations about the loan.  If 
weaknesses or evidence of imprudent handling cannot be 
identified, inclusion of such loans in Special Mention is 
not justified.
