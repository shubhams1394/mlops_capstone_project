for bank management.  While Special Mention Assets 
should not be combined with adversely classified assets ,   
their total should be considered in the anal ysis of asset 
quality and management, as appropriate. 
 
The nature of this category precludes inclusion of smaller 
lines of credit unless those loans are part of a large 
grouping listed for related reasons.  Comments on loans 
listed for Special Mention in t he Report of Examination 
should be drafted in a fashion similar to those for 
adversely classified loans.  There is no less of a 
requirement upon the examiner to record clearly the 
reasons why the loan is listed.  The major thrust of the 
comments should be towards achieving correction of the 
deficiencies identified.
