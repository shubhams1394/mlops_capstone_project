NPV of t otal risk -adjusted proved reserves should be 
classified Substandard.  When the potential for loss may 
be mitigated by the outcome of certain pending events, or 
when loss is expected but the amount of the loss cannot be 
reasonably determined, the remaining balance secured by 
the NPV of total unrisked proved reserves should be 
classified Doubtful.  The portion of the loan 
commitment(s) that exceeds 100 percent of the NPV of 
total unrisked proved reserves, and is uncollectible, should 
be classified Loss.  These guidelines may be adjusted 
depending on the borrower’s specific situation and should 
not replace examiner judgment.
