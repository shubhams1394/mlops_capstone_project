bankers should realistically evaluate lending policies and 
individual loans in light of changing conditions.  
Economic downturns can adversely affect borrowers' 
repayment potential and can lessen a bank's collateral 
protection.  Reliance on previously existing conditions as 
well as optimistic hopes for economic improvement can, 
particularly when coupled with one or more of the causes 
and sources of loan problems previously mentioned, lead 
to serious loan portfolio deterioration. 
 
Competition 
 
Competition among financial institutions for growth, 
profitability, and community i nfluence sometimes results 
in the compromise of sound credit principles and 
acquisition of unsound loans.  The ultimate cost of 
unsound loans outweighs temporary gains in growth, 
income and influence.
