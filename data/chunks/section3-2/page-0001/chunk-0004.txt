characteristics of individual loans preclude establishment 
of standard or universal lending policies.  There are, 
however, certain broad areas of consideration and concern 
that should be addressed in the lending policies of all 
banks regardless of size or location.  These include the 
following, as minimums:  
   
• General fields of lending in which the bank will 
engage and  the kinds or types of loans within each 
general field; 
• Lending authority of each loan officer;  
• Lending authority of a loan or executive committee, if 
any; 
• Responsibility of the board of directors in reviewing, 
ratifying, or approving loans; 
• Guidelines under which unsecured loans will be 
granted; 
• Guidelines for rates of interest and the terms of 
repayment for secured and unsecured loans; 
• Limitations on the amount advanced in relation to the 
value of the collateral and the documentation required 
by the bank for each type of secured loan;
