buying bank attempts to utilize the acquired funds to 
support a rapid expansion of its loan- investment posture 
and as a means of enhancing profits.  Of particular concern 
to the examiner is that, in many cases, the selling bank will 
automatically conclude that the buying bank's financial 
condition is above reproach without proper investigation 
and analysis.  If this becomes the case, the selling bank 
may be taking an unacceptable risk unknowingly.  
 
Another area of potential risk involves selling Federal 
funds to a bank which may be acting as an intermedi ary 
between the selling bank and the ultimate buying bank.  In 
this instance, the intermediary bank is acting as agent with 
the true liability for repayment accruing to the third bank.  
Therefore, it is particularly important that the original 
selling bank be aware of this situation, ascertain the 
ultimate disposition of its funds, and be satisfied as to the 
creditworthiness of the ultimate buyer of the funds.
