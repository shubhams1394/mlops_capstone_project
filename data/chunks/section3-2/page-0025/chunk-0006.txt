livestock may be somewhat less liquid than feeder 
livestock or grain, but values are nonetheless reasonably 
well known and report ed through local or regional media 
or auction houses.  If such information on breeding 
livestock is unavailable or is considered unreliable, 
slaughter prices may be used as an alternative (these 
slaughter prices comprise “liquidation” rather than “going 
concern” values).  The extent of use and level of 
maintenance received significantly affect machinery and 
equipment values.  Determining collateral values can 
therefore be very difficult as maintenance and usage levels 
vary significantly.  Nonetheless, value s for certain pre -
owned machinery and equipment, especially tractors, 
combines, and other harvesting or crop tillage equipment, 
are published in specialized guides and are based on prices 
paid at farm equipment dealerships or auctions.  These 
used machiner y guides may be used as a reasonableness
