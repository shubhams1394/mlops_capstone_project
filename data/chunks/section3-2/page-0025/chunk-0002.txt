to administer the credit. 
 
Banks should be given some reasonable flexibility as to 
the level of sophistication or comprehensiveness of the 
aforementioned financial information, and the frequency 
with which it is obtained, depending upon such factors as 
the credit size, the type of loans involved, the financial 
strength and trends of the borrower, and the economic, 
climatic or other external conditions which may affect loan 
repayment.  It may therefore be inappropriate for the 
examiner to insist that all agricultural borrowers be 
supported with the full complement of balance sheets, 
income statements, and other data discussed above, 
regardless of the nature and amount of the credit or the 
debtor’s financial strength and payment record.  
Nonetheless, while recognizing some leeway is 
appropriate, most of the bank’s agricultural credit lines, 
and all of its larger or more significant ones, s hould be 
sufficiently supported by the financial information 
mentioned.
