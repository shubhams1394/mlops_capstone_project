Modification of Terms -  When the terms of a TDR  
provide for a reduction of interest  or principal, the 
institution should measure any loss on the restructuring in 
accordance with  the guidance for impaired loans as set 
forth in FAS 114 unless the loans are measured at fair 
value or the lower of cost or fair value. If the fair value of 
the restructured loan is less than the book value of that 
loan, FAS 114 requires impairment to be recognized as a 
valuation allowance against the loan.  For regulatory 
reporting and examination report purposes, this valuation 
allowance should be included as part of  ALLL.  If the 
excess amount of the loan’s book value is determined to be 
uncollectible, this excess amount should be promptly 
charged-off against the ALLL.
