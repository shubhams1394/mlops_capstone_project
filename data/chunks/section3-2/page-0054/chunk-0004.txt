Examination Report Treatment  - Examiners should 
continue to classify troubled loans, including any troubled 
collateral dependent loans, based on the definitions of 
Loss, Doubtful, and Substandard.  When a loan is 
collateral dependent, any portion of the loan balance 
which exceeds the fair value of the collateral should be 
promptly charged-off against the ALLL.  For other loans 
that are impaired or have been restructured, the excess of 
the book value of the loan over it s fair value (or fair value 
less cost to sell, as appropriate) is recognized by creating a 
valuation allowance which is included in the ALLL.   
However, when available information confirms that loans 
and leases (including any recorded accrued interest, net  
deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized premium or 
discount) other than collateral dependent loans, or portions 
thereof, are uncollectible, these amounts should be 
promptly charged- off against the ALLL, regardless of
