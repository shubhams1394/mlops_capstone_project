separate matters; restructuring a borrower’s debt does not 
ensure collection of the loan or security.   As with all other 
assets, adverse classification should be assigned if analysis 
indicates there is risk of loss present.  Examiners should 
take care, however, not to discourage or be critical of bank 
management’s legitimate and reasonable attempts to 
achieve debt settlements through concessionary terms.  In 
many cases, restructurings offer the only realistic means 
for a bank to bring about collection of weak or nonearning 
assets.  Finally, the volume of impaired loans and 
restructured debts having concessionary interest rates 
should be considered when evaluating the bank’s earnings 
performance and assigning the earnings performance 
rating.
