lot development in anticipation of further construction 
or sale of the property.  A land development loan 
should be predicated upon a proper title search and/or 
mortgage insurance.  The loan amount should be 
based on appraisals on an "as is" and "as completed" 
basis.  Projections should be accompanied by a study 
explaining the effect of property improvements on the 
market value of the land.  There should be a sufficient 
spread between the amount of the development loan 
and the estimated market value to allow for 
unforeseen expenses.  The repayment program should 
be structured to follow the sales or development 
program.  In the case of  an unsecured land 
development loan to investors or speculators, bank 
management should analyze the borrower's financial 
statements for sources of repayment other than the 
expected return on the property development.
