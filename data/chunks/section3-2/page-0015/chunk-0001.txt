methods that are producing at the time of the 
engineering report estimate.   
• PDNP reserves include both shut -in (PDSI) and  
behind the pipe (PDBP) reserves, and production can 
be initiated or restored with relatively low 
expenditures compared to the cost of drilling a new 
well. 
- PDSI reserves are completion intervals that are 
open, but have not started producing; were shut-in 
for market conditions or pipeline connections; or 
not capable of production for mechanical reasons.   
- PDBP reserves are those expected to be recovered 
from existing wells that require additional 
completion work or future completion prior to the 
start of production.   
• PUD reserves are expected to be recovered only after 
making future investment.  These reserves have been 
proved by independent engineering reports, but do not 
have a well infrastructure in place.
