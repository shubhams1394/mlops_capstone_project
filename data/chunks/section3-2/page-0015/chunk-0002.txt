proved by independent engineering reports, but do not 
have a well infrastructure in place.     
 
Other categories of reserves include “pr obable” (P2) and 
“possible” (P3).  Probable reserves are relatively 
uncertain, while possible reserves are considered 
speculative in nature.  Probable and possible reserves 
should not receive any value when determining the 
borrowing base.   
 
Reserve Engineering Reports 
 
Reserve engineering reports are an estimate of the volumes 
of O&G reserves that are likely to be recovered based on 
reasonable assumptions regarding physical characteristics 
of the reservoir, available technology, and operating 
efficiencies.  The significant reliance on engineering 
reports in underwriting RBL facilities requires sound 
internal controls over the collateral evaluation process.  
Reserve reports must be objective; based on reasonable, 
well-documented assumptions; and completed 
independently of the loan origination and collection
