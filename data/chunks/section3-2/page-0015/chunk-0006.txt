location of reserve fields, and bank management should 
establish limits on the lowest number of producing we lls 
needed to establish an acceptable borrowing base.   
 
Typically, the advance rate for high -quality proved (P1) 
reserves should rarely exceed 65 percent (a typical range is 
50 to 65 percent) of the PV of FNR.  If the lender 
determines that PDNP or PUD re serves are to be 
considered in the borrowing base, these reserves should 
generally not exceed 25 to 35 percent of the total 
borrowing base.  In addition, PDNP and PUD reserves 
should be risk-adjusted (65 to 75 percent for PDNP and 25 
to 50 percent for PUD,  for example) prior to applying the 
advance rate.  Lenders may apply separate risk -adjusted 
advance rates for each proved reserve category in the 
borrowing base.  During extended periods of low or 
declining commodity prices, it is not uncommon for banks 
to increase the risk adjustment for PDNP and PUD 
reserves.
