well-documented assumptions; and completed 
independently of the loan origination and collection 
functions.  Management must be able to document the 
qualifications and independence of the engineer, and 
should periodically evaluate the production performance, 
which should include a comparison of produc tion 
projections to actual results. 
 
RBL collateral value consists of a point-in-time estimate of 
the present value (PV) of future net revenue (FNR) 
derived from the production and sale of existing O&G 
reserves, net of operating expenses, production taxes,  
royalties, and CAPEX, discounted at an appropriate rate.  
The engineering reports should contain sufficient 
information and documentation to support the assumptions 
and the analysis used to derive the forecasted cash flows 
and discounted PV.  Bank managem ent should provide 
clear guidance to the engineer at engagement regarding 
discount rates, pricing assumptions, operating expense
