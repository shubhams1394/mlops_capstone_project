national and global economies, and the U.S. financial 
industry plays an integral role in making credit available 
and syndicating that credit to investors.  In particular, 
financial institutions should ensure they do not 
unnecessarily heighten risks by originating poorly 
underwritten loans.  For example, a poorly underwritten 
leveraged loan that is pooled with other loans or is 
participated with other institutions may generate ri sks for 
the financial system.  
 
Numerous definitions of leveraged lending exist 
throughout the financial services industry and commonly 
contain some combination of the following:  
• Proceeds used for buyouts, acquisitions, or capital 
distributions.  
• Transactions where the borrower’s Total Debt divided 
by EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation, and amortization) or Senior Debt 
divided by EBITDA exceed 4.0X EBITDA or 3.0X 
EBITDA, respectively, or other defined levels 
appropriate to the industry or sector.
