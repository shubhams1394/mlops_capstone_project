analysis.  
 
For purposes of Reports of Condition and Income  (Call 
Reports) and Thrift Financial Reports (TFR) an adequate 
ALLL should, after deduction of all assets classified loss, 
be no less than the sum of the following items:   
 
• For loans and leases classified Substandard or 
Doubtful, whether analyzed and provided for 
individually or as part of pools, all estimated credit 
losses over the remaining effective lives of these 
loans. 
• For loans and leases that are not classified, all 
estimated credit losses over the upcoming 12 months. 
• Amounts for estimated losses from transfer risk on 
international loans. 
 
Furthermore, management’s analysis of an adequate 
reserve level should be conservative to reflect a margin for 
the imprecision inherent in most estimates of expected 
credit losses.   This additional margin might be 
incorporated through amounts attributed to individual 
loans or groups of loans, or in an unallocated portion of 
the ALLL.
