principles (GAAP).  When available information confirms 
specific loans and leases, or portions thereof, to be 
uncollectible, these amounts should be promptly charged-
off against the ALLL. 
 
Estimated credit losses should reflect consideration of all 
significant factors that affect repayment as of the 
evaluation date.  Estimated losses on loan pools should 
reflect historical net charge- off levels for similar loans, 
adjusted for changes in current conditions or other relevant 
factors.  Calculation of historical charge -off rates can 
range from a simple average of net charge- offs over a 
relevant period, to more complex techniques, such as 
migration analysis. 
 
Portions of the ALLL can be attributed to, or based upon 
the risks associated with, individual loans or groups of 
loans.  However, the ALLL is available to absorb credit 
losses that arise from the entire portfolio.  It is not 
segregated for any particular loan, or group of loans.
