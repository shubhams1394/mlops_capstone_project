December 31, 2001, which are subject to implicit 
(unwritten, noncontractual) recourse provisions may be 
accounted for as sales by both the seller and the purchas er 
for financial reporting purposes, provided the other sales 
criteria addressed above are met.  However, if the seller 
demonstrates intent to repurchase participations sold in the 
event of default even in the absence of a formal obligation 
to do so, then these participations will be treated as assets 
sold with recourse when calculating the seller's risk -based 
capital ratios.  Consistent with an AICPA auditing 
interpretation, FDIC-insured institutions which account for 
loan participations transferred after December 31, 2001, as 
sales rather than as secured borrowings for financial 
reporting purposes should generally do so only if the 
participation agreement is supported by a legal opinion 
explaining how the isolation test for sales accounting 
treatment is met given the FDIC's receivership powers.
