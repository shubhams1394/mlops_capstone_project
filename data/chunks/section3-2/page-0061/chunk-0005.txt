vulnerability of security interests perfected by doing 
nothing.  While these interests are perfected automatically, 
with the date of perfection being the date of attachment, 
they are extremely vulnerab le at the hands of subsequent 
bona fide purchasers.  Suppose, for example, a dealer sells 
a television set on a secured basis to an ultimate consumer.  
Since the collateral is consumer goods, the security interest 
is perfected the moment if attaches.  But if the original 
buyer sells the television set to another person who buys it 
in good faith and in ignorance of the outstanding security 
interest, the UCC provides that the subsequent purchase 
cuts off the dealer's security interest.  This second 
exception is much the same as the first except for one 
important difference: the dealer (creditor) in this case can 
be protected against purchase of a customer's collateral by 
filing a financing statement with the appropriate public 
official.
