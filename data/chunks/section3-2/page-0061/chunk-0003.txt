the collateral may be public or private, notice to the debtor 
and other secured parties must generally be given.  The 
sale must be commercially reasonable in all respects.  
Debtors are entitled to any surplus resulting from sale 
price of the collateral less any unpaid debt.  If a deficiency 
occurs (i.e., the proceeds from sale of the collateral were 
inadequate to fully extin guish the debt obligation), the
