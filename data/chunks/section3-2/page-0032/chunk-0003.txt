approach is usually the appropriate method for 
valuing the property.   The income approach converts 
all expected future net operating income into present 
value terms.  When m arket conditions are stable and 
no unusual patterns of future rents and occupancy 
rates are expected, the direct capitalization method is 
often used to estimate the present value of future 
income streams.  For troubled properties, however, the 
more explicit discounted cash flow (net present value) 
method is more typically utilized for analytical 
purposes.  In the rent method, a time frame for 
achieving a "stabilized", or normal, occupancy and 
rent level is projected.  Each year's net operating 
income during that period is discounted to arrive at 
present value of expected future cash flows.   The 
property's anticipated sales value at the end of the 
period until stabilization (its terminal or reversion 
value) is then estimated.  The reversion value
