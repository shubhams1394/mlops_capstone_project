profiles than exist in subprime loan programs.  Therefore, 
these requirements may not be sufficient to reflect the risks 
associated with subprime portfolios.  Each subprime 
lender is responsible for quantifying the amount of capital 
needed to offset the additional risk in subprime lending 
activities, and for fully documenting the methodology and 
analysis supporting the amount specified.  
 
Examiners will evaluate the capital adequacy of subprime 
lenders on a case- by-case basis, considering, among other 
factors, the institution’s own documented analysis of the 
capital needed to support its subprime lending activities.  
Examiners should expect capital levels to be risk sensitive, 
that is, allocated capital should reflect the level and 
variability of loss estimates within reasonably conservative 
parameters.  Examiners should also expect institutions to 
specify a direct link between the estimated loss rates used 
to determine the required ALLL, and the unexpected loss
