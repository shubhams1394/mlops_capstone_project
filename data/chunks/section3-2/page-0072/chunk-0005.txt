specify a direct link between the estimated loss rates used 
to determine the required ALLL, and the unexpected loss 
estimates used to determine capital.  
 
The sophistication of this analysis should be 
commensurate with the size, concentration level, and 
relative risk of the institution’s subprime lending activities 
and should consider the following elements:   
 
• Portfolio growth rates; 
• Trends in the level and volatility of expected losses; 
• The level of subprime loan losses incurred over one or 
more economic downturns, if such data/analyses are 
available; 
• The impact of planned underwriting or marketing 
changes on the credit characteristics of the portfolio, 
including the relative levels of risk of default, loss in 
the event of default, and the level of classified assets; 
• Any deterioration in the average  credit quality over 
time due to adverse selection or retention; 
• The amount, quality, and liquidity of collateral 
securing the individual loans;
