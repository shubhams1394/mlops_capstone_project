sponsors two independent boards referred to in Title XI, 
The Appraiser Qualifications Board (AQB) and The 
Appraisal Standards Board (ASB).  Title XI specifies that 
the minimum standards for state appraiser certification are 
to be the criteria for certification issued by the AQB.  Title 
XI does not set specific criteria for the licensed 
classification.  These are individually determined by each 
state.  Additionally, Title XI requires that the appraisal  
standards prescribed by the Federal agencies, at a 
minimum, must be the appraisal standards promulgated by 
the ASB.  The ASB has issued The Uniform Standards of 
Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) which set the 
appraisal industry standards for conduct ing an appraisal of 
real estate.  To the appraisal industry, USPAP is analogous 
to generally accepted accounting principles for the 
accounting profession.
